              We have a dedicated platform for aadhar enabled payment
              system that can help you to provide customers in your area
              with the AEPS portal and AEPS services that can help them
              withdraw, deposit money, and know their bank status by
              balance inquiry and mini statement and they also can send
              money through Aadhar number only to another Aadhar number
              they have available.

              One only needs to find out if they want to provide these
              services in their area or not by finding the needs of
              Aadhar-based money withdrawals in their area so they can
              know that they have to use the Aadhar payment system for
              their targeted system. We have got it all covered we provide
              one with the Aeps retailer ID to register them and after
              that, they can manage the different transactions with the
              help of anyoneâ€™s Aadhar card and they can also track the
              transactions they have done so when it is the time of
              transaction they can easily get it and can provide proof of
              payments done from there side if there is a need to show
              proof.
